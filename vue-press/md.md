Certainly! Here are some common Markdown formatting elements, including lists:

1. **Headings**:
   - To create a heading, use number signs (hashes) in front of a word or phrase. The number of hashes corresponds to the heading level.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     # Heading level 1
     ## Heading level 2
     ### Heading level 3
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use equals signs (`=`) for heading level 1 and hyphens (`-`) for heading level 2.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     Heading level 1
     ===============
     
     Heading level 2
     ---------------
     ```

2. **Paragraphs**:
   - Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     I really like using Markdown.
     
     I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.
     ```

3. **Line Breaks**:
   - To create a line break (new line), end a line with two or more spaces and then press Enter.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     This is the first line.  
     And this is the second line.
     ```

4. **Ordered Lists** (Numbered Lists):
   - Use numbers followed by periods to create an ordered list.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     1. First item
     2. Second item
        - Subitem A
        - Subitem B
     3. Third item
     ```

5. **Unordered Lists** (Bullet Points):
   - Use asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`) to create an unordered list.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     - Item 1
       - Subitem A
       - Subitem B
     - Item 2
       * Subitem C
       * Subitem D
     ```

Remember that Markdown syntax is widely supported, but there might be minor variations between different processors.
